## üí≠ Personal Experience
Creating this game was an interesting and enriching experience. It showed me how much effort is required to create your own game. However,
working on this project was a lot of fun and great opportunity to learn new things, such as game development, including mechanics, world creation, design,
and storytelling. I enjoyed tackling challenges, despite the fact that sometimes they were a struggle, but they ultimately led me to a better understanding 
of game desing. The hardest and most arduous part of the project was finding and creating/changing graphics that would match the game's theme.
